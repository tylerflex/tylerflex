My name is Tyler W Hughes.  I'm a research scientist specializing in computational physics.

My main github account is [@twhughes](https://github.com/twhughes/twhughes).

In late 2019, I completed my PhD in applied physics from Stanford University working in the group of [Professor Shanhui Fan](https://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/).  Here I worked on many projects in photonics, including laser-driven particle accelerators on a chip, optical machine learning hardware, and computational inverse design.

Since then I have been developing technology for fast, large scale electromagnetic simulations at [Flexcompute Inc.](https://www.flexcompute.com/).
